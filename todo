overview todo/pseudocode:
- you get user input via prompt
- user input should be case insensitive
- there should be a function that randomly selects rock, paper, scissors for the computer.
- this computerPlay function will return its result as computerSelection
- there will be a function that plays a single round of RPS playRound(), which will take 2 parameters
- the 2 params are: playerSelection and computerSelection
- at the end it will return a string like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
- write another function, that will play 5 rounds, 
- keeps score and reports the overall winner at the end
