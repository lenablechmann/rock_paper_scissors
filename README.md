# Rock Paper Scissors
Web app rock paper scissors in Javascript, CSS and HTML. 
At first it's going to be console.log only, then the interface will be added.

## Goals of this project:
- developing an algorithm for rock paper scissors in Javascript
- practicing vanilla CSS and HTML
- learn how to plan JS + HTML + CSS web apps
- ideally I'd like to make it somewhat responsive
- UX UI
